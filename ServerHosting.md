Server Hosting
==============

All multiplayer servers are hosted using the Unturned Dedicated Server tool, which is installed and updated through Valve's [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) tool.

How to Install SteamCMD on Linux

How to Install Server using SteamCMD
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Login to Steam anonymously:

		login anonymous

2. Download the server:

		app_update 1110390

	_Note: this command can also be used to update the server._

3. Close SteamCMD:

		quit

4. The server files are now in the SteamCMD > steamapps > common > U3DS directory.

How to Launch Server on Windows
-------------------------------

1. Navigate to the SteamCMD > steamapps > common > U3DS directory.
2. Right-click within the folder.
3. Select New > Text Document
4. Replace "New Text Document.txt" with "Tutorial.bat"
5. Right-click on the batch script (`Tutorial.bat`) and select Edit.
6. For an internet server insert the following text into the file:

		start %~dp0ServerHelper.bat +InternetServer/MyServer

	Alternatively, for a LAN server insert the following text into the file:

		start %~dp0ServerHelper.bat +LanServer/MyServer

	_Note: In this example MyServer is used as the ServerID for savedata and configuration purposes._

7. Save your changes.
8. Double-click the batch script to launch the server.
3. Cleanly shutdown the server once it finishes loading:

		shutdown

	Running it will have created a "MyServer" directory in U3DS > Servers. This is where all savedata and configuration files are kept. Changing the `MyServer` ServerID in the batch script can be done to run multiple servers at once, or to keep savedata separate.

For an example script open the built-in `ExampleServer.bat` file.

How to Launch Server on Linux
-----------------------------

1. Navigate to the SteamCMD > steamapps > common > U3DS directory.
2. For an internet server run the following command:

		./ServerHelper.sh +InternetServer/MyServer

	Alternatively, for a LAN server run the following command:

		./ServerHelper.sh +LanServer/MyServer

	_Note: In this example MyServer is used as the ServerID for savedata and configuration purposes._

3. Cleanly shutdown the server once it finishes loading:

		shutdown

	Running it will have created a "MyServer" directory in U3DS > Servers. This is where all savedata and configuration files are kept. Changing the `MyServer` ServerID in the launch arguments can be done to run multiple servers at once, or to keep savedata separate.

For an example script open the built-in `ExampleServer.sh` file.

How to Configure Server
-----------------------

Each individual ServerID has its own savedata and configuration.

1. Determine the ServerID. This is the name after the +InternetServer/ or +LanServer/ command.
2. Navigate to U3DS > Servers > ServerID.

Launch commands are setup in the Server > `Commands.dat` file. Each line should have one command.

Common useful commands are:

- __Map__: Specify the map to load by name, otherwise PEI is used.

	Examples:

		Map PEI
		Map Washington
		Map Russia

- __Port__: Running multiple internet servers simultaneously requires specifying different ports. Unturned will use the set port for game traffic, port + 1 for server list queries and port + 2 for the Steam backend. Recommended port values are 27015 for the first server, 27018 for the second server, so on and so forth.

	Examples:

		Port 27015
		Port 27018

- __Name__: Name of the server on the server list; set as "Unturned" by default.
- __Password__: Requires password to join server. Note that password is only SHA1 hashed, so don't use the same password anywhere else.
- __Perspective__: Can be set to "First", "Third", "Both", or "Vehicle" to change camera options.
- __Cheats__: Allows admins to invoke cheat commands like spawning items or vehicles from the chat.

Game rules, listing display, and many other options are available in the `Config.json` file. Game options mirror the in-game Play > Singleplayer > Config menu. This file deserves further documentation, but is not officially documented yet.

Steam Workshop add-ons (e.g., maps, items, vehicles) are setup in the `WorkshopDownloadConfig.json` file.
To include a Workshop file on your server:

1. Browse to its web page, for example: [Hawaii](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1753134636)
2. Copy the file ID from the end of the URL.

		URL: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1753134636
		ID: 1753134636

3. Insert the file ID into the File_IDs list:

		"File_IDs":
		[
			1753134636
		],

	Multiple file IDs should be separated by commas:

		"File_IDs":
		[
			1753134636,
			1702240229
		],

4. During startup the files will be updated, and any dependencies detected. Players will have the files downloaded while connecting to the server.
